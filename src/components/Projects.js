                998 is a transformative sonic journey.



                Guided by the phantasmagoric sound of an orange electric guitar, this experience leads to discovering an unforeseen horizon where different music styles resonate together. J.S. Bach’s masterpiece Prelude, Fugue, Allegro (BWV 998) is the starting point from which a sonic constellation of new music languages is shaped around drone music, avant-garde, post-rock, psychedelic music and minimalism.



                In 998 the compositional material of Bach's piece - originally written for the lautenwerk, a keyboard instrument similar to the harpsichord but sounding like the archlute - is deconstructed and distorted as if it goes through an existential trip made of electric sounds. While preserving the work’s original three-part development, this interpretative invention for electric guitar traces a path that begins with the intuition of the higher harmonics revealed by the long sustained tones of the Prelude, then resolves into the hypnotic repetition of the Fugue’s subject as it varies and layers over time, building toward imposing walls of noise at the moment of maximum paroxysm, only to disintegrate in an instant and finally rise again in the ethereal chord progressions of the Allegro.



                998 spins upon itself, eventually returning to new life and inspiring multiple imaginary scenarios of listening and creation. This music outlines a tour through distant musical styles celebrating the pure essence and energy of sound.
